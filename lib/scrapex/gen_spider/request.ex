  Conveniences for spawing and awaiting for HTTP requests.

  Requests are processes meant to perform one particular HTTP request
  to a specific URL throughout their life-cycle, often with little or
  no communication with other processes.

  Requests spawned with `async/2` can be awaited on by its caller
  process (and only its caller). They are implemented  by spawing a
  `Task` and await on it.

  The Request struct.

  It contains the following fields:

    * `:pid` - the process reference of the request process.

    * `:ref` - the request monitor reference.

    * `:owner` - the PID of the process that started the request.

    * `:url` - the url to make request to.

  Starts an asynchronous request that can be awaited on.

  This function spawns a Task that is linked to and monitored by the

  The reply sent by the request will be the of the underlying `Task`,
  i.e., in the format `{ref, msg}`, where `ref` is the monitoring ref
  held by the request, and `msg` is the return value of the callback.
